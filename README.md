Bus provides a lock-free, bounded, single-producer, multi-consumer, broadcast channel.

> NOTE!: There is an issue in the current implementation which causes CPU usage during idle operation. See [#23](https://github.com/jonhoo/bus/issues/23). Consider using [tokio::sync::broadcast](https://docs.rs/tokio/0.3.5/tokio/sync/broadcast/) instead of this crate.

It uses a circular buffer and atomic instructions to implement a lock-free single-producer,
multi-consumer channel. The interface is similar to that of the `std::sync::mpsc` channels,
except that multiple consumers (readers of the channel) can be produced, whereas only a single
sender can exist. Furthermore, in contrast to most multi-consumer FIFO queues, bus is
*broadcast*; every send goes to every consumer.

I haven't seen this particular implementation in literature (some extra bookkeeping is
necessary to allow multiple consumers), but a lot of related reading can be found in Ross
Bencina's blog post ["Some notes on lock-free and wait-free
algorithms"](http://www.rossbencina.com/code/lockfree).

See [the documentation] for usage examples.
